# Online Food Delivery Service

This project is an online food delivery system developed as part of the Software Project course at the Federal University of Alagoas (Universidade Federal de Alagoas - UFAL), taught by Professor Dr. Baldo√≠no Fonseca dos Santos Neto.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following modules:

1. **users.py**: Contains the `User`, `Customer`, and `Owner` classes. These classes represent the users of the system, with `Customer` and `Owner` being subclasses of the abstract `User` class.

2. **support.py**: Implements the `Support` class, which handles customer support tickets.

3. **review.py**: Implements the `Review` class, which allows customers to add, update, and delete reviews for restaurants.

4. **restaurant.py**: Implements the `Restaurant` class, which represents a restaurant and includes functionality for managing menus, reviews, and promotions.

5. **promotion.py**: Implements the `Promotion` class, which allows restaurant owners to manage promotions and discounts.

6. **payment.py**: Implements the `Payment` abstract class and its subclasses (`CreditCard`, `DebitCard`, `Pix`, and `Cash`) for handling different payment methods.

7. **order.py**: Implements the `Order` class, which represents an order placed by a customer at a restaurant.

8. **menu.py**: Implements the `Menu` class, which allows restaurant owners to manage the menu items and their prices.

9. **delivery.py**: Implements the `Delivery` class, which tracks the status of an order's delivery.
